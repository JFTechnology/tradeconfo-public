		Tradeconfo.com is a multitenancy service. It supports multiple
		<em>
			<a href="#domains">'domains'</a>
		</em>
		each
		representing an customer firm (typically an FX brokerage). Each
		<a href="#domains">domain</a>
		contains
		data segregated into
		<em>
			<a href="domain-groups">'domain-groups'</a>
		</em>
		or silos. These are typically used to
		represent business units within a firm.
		This documentation set covers resources
		that are
		made available via three APIs...
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>fx-customer-api</dt>
		<dd>
			Application that supports access to one or more
			<a href="#customer-accounts">customer-accounts</a>
			by a
			single
			<a href="#people">user</a>
			. This application is intended to face a customer of an FX brokerage.
		</dd>
		<dt>fx-domain-api</dt>
		<dd>
			Application that supports access to one or more
			<a href="#domain-groups">domain-groups</a>
			within single
			<a href="#domains">domain</a>
			. This application is intended to face an employee or agent of an FX
			brokerage.
		</dd>
		<dt>fx-admin-api</dt>
		<dd>
			Application that supports user access to multiple
			<a href="#domains">domains</a>
			.
		</dd>

	<p>
		Several of the resources documented below include relationships that are
		only
		relevant to certain applications. In particular resources such as
		<a href="#customer-accounts">customer accounts</a>
		optionally contain a
		<a href="#domains">domain</a>
		and a
		<a href="#domain-groups">domain-group</a>
		relationship. Clients of the fx-customer-api should not rely on these
		relationships being included in responses (and have no
		need of them). Likewise
		clients of
		the fx-domain-api can expect responses to include
		<a href="#domain-groups">domain-group</a>
		relationships but not
		<a href="#domains">domain</a>
		relationships.
