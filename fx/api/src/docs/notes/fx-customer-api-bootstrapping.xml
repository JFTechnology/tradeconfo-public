	<p>
		Once an access token for a resource owner (user) has been obtained from the
		OAuth2 server the client can make calls into the API. However the client will
		not know the
		<a href="#people">person</a>
		resource representing the resource owner on the system or the
		<a href="#customer-accounts">customer accounts</a>
		that the resource owner has access to.
	</p>
	<p>
		The client can bootstrap into this information by a call to the
		<strong>
			<a href="#user-profiles">'GET /user-profile/self'</a>
		</strong>
		end point. The returned resource will contain the details of the
		<a href="#people">user</a>
		and an array of
		<a href="#customer-account-profiles">customer-account-profiles</a>
		for each
		<a href="#customer-accounts">customer-account</a>
		that the resource owner has access to.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
			NOTE :
			The call to
			<a href="#user-profiles">'GET /user-profiles/self'</a>
			is intended to be the only call required by client to obtain all the 'static'
			data for setting up a client interface.
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The complete relationship graph
		should be sideloaded in the response to
		<a href="#user-profiles">'GET /user-profiles/self'</a>
		via the JSON API included mechanism. For example recursive calls
		to
		<a href="#people">'GET /people/self'</a>
		(that would return the resource corresponding to the resource owner), or
		<a href="#customer-account-profiles">'GET /customer-account-profiles'</a>
		(that would return all the customer accounts for the resource owner), though
		valid, should never be required.
