		This API is versioned using the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH semver convention
		<a href='http://semver.org'>(http://semver.org)</a>
		.
	</p>

	<p>The MAJOR version will be incremented for changes that break backward
		compatability. As the API can be considered stable this is expected to happen
		very infrequently.</p>
	<p>The MINOR version will be incremented for any changes to the API that maintain
		forward comapatability. Additional resources or the addition of
		non-required
		resource attributes and relationships to an existing resource will
		result in a
		MINOR version bump only.</p>
	<p>The PATCH version will be incremented for updates and improvements to
		documentation that do not affect the API structure in any way.</p>
	<p>Future MAJOR version increments will be supported using the standard HTTP
		header mechanism. If no header is present client applications should assume the
		version is 1.x</p>
