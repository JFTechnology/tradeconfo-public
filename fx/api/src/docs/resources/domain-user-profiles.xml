			Bootstrap resource that returns the profile of the resource owner.
			Clients can expect the
			entire relationship graph of 'static' data required by
			the user to be
			sideloaded vie the JSON API included mechanism - therefore this
			is the only
			call that should be necessary to set up a customer UI.
